This project will be a similar construction to the monthly challenges project that was created from the Django course I am currently taking.

The recipes list project is created to practice the topics learned in the course and throghout the project:
  1. URLs
  2. Views
  3. Templates
  4. Static Files

The goal for this project is to have a full grasp of the 4 topics listed above, by implementing my own version of the 4 topics, and being able to get a successful Django project.

There will also be an implementation of HTML and CSS to create the structure and styling to make the website stand out.
